"""
ROS Bag Parser for Extracting Time-Series Data from Specific Topics.

This script processes a ROS1 `.bag` file and extracts time-aligned data from selected topics.
It is useful for preparing datasets for machine learning or analysis by converting ROS messages
(e.g., images, transforms) into a structured dictionary format and saving it as a `.pkl` file.

Core Features:
--------------
- Extracts messages and timestamps from specified ROS topics.
- Organizes data in a dictionary with the format:
    - "t_<topic_name>": list of timestamps in seconds
    - "y_<topic_name>": list of associated float-encoded message data
- Saves the extracted data to disk as a Python pickle file.

Placeholders:
-------------
- `image_to_float`: Needs implementation for extracting visual features from image data.
- `tf_to_float`: Needs implementation for converting transformation messages to floats.

Dependencies:
-------------
- ROS (rospy, rosbag)
- OpenCV + cv_bridge
- NumPy
- Pickle
