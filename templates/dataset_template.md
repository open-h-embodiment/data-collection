## üìã At a Glance

*Provide a one-sentence summary of your dataset.*

**Example:** *Teleoperated demonstrations of a da Vinci robot performing needle passing on a silicone phantom.*

---

## üìñ Dataset Overview

*Briefly describe the purpose and content of this dataset. What key skills or scenarios does it demonstrate?*

**Example:** *This dataset contains 2,500 trajectories of expert surgeons using the dVRK to perform surgical suturing tasks. It includes successful trials, failures, and recovery attempts to provide a robust dataset for training imitation learning policies.*

## üî¨ Data Collection Details

### Collection Method

*How was the data collected?*

- [ ] **Human Teleoperation**
- [ ] **Programmatic/State-Machine**
- [ ] **AI Policy / Autonomous**
- [ ] **Other** (Please specify: `[Your Method]`)

### Operator Details

| | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Operator Count** | `[Number of unique people who collected data]` |
| **Operator Skill Level** | `[ ] Expert (e.g., Surgeon, Sonographer)` <br> `[ ] Intermediate (e.g., Trained Researcher)` <br> `[ ] Novice (e.g., ML Researcher with minimal experience)` <br> `[ ] N/A` |
| **Collection Period** | From `[YYYY-MM-DD]` to `[YYYY-MM-DD]` |

### Recovery Demonstrations

*Does this dataset include examples of recovering from failure?*

- [ ] **Yes**
- [ ] **No**

**If yes, please briefly describe the recovery process:**

*Example: For 250 demonstrations, demonstrations are initialized from a failed needle grasp position, the operator re-orients the robotic grippers and attempts to grasp the needle again from a different angle.*

## üí° Diversity Dimensions

*Check all dimensions that were intentionally varied during data collection.*

- [ ] **Camera Position / Angle**
- [ ] **Lighting Conditions**
- [ ] **Target Object** (e.g., different phantom models, suture types)
- [ ] **Spatial Layout** (e.g., placing the target suture needle in various locations)
- [ ] **Robot Embodiment** (if multiple robots were used)
- [ ] **Task Execution** (e.g., different techniques for the same task)
- [ ] **Background / Scene**
- [ ] **Other** (Please specify: `[Your Dimension]`)

*If you checked any of the above please briefly elaborate below.*

**Example:** We adjusted the room camera perspective every 100 demonstrations. The camera angle was varied by panning up and down by +/- 10 degrees, as well as manually adjusting the height of the camera mount by +/- 2 cm. Additionally, we varied the needle used by swapping out various curvatures, including 1/4, 3/8, 1/2, and 5/8.

| Type | Model/Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Camera** | `[e.g., Endoscopic Camera, 1920x1080 @ 30fps]` |
| **Room/3rd Person Camera** | `[e.g., Logitech C920, 1920x1080 @ 30fps]` |
| **Force/Torque Sensor** | `[e.g., ATI Nano25]` |
| **Medical Imager** | `[e.g., GE Voluson E10 Ultrasound, B-Mode]` |
| **Other** | `[Specify]` |

## ‚è±Ô∏è Data Synchronization Approach

*Describe how you achieved proper data synchronization across different sensors, cameras, and robotic systems during data collection. This is crucial for ensuring temporal alignment of all modalities in your dataset.*

**Example:** *We collect joint kinematics from our Franka Research 3 and RGB-D frames from Intel RealSense D435 cameras, all running in ROS 2 Galactic on the same workstation clocked with ROS Time. Both drivers stamp their outgoing messages‚Äô header.stamp fields with the shared system clock, and we record /joint_states, /camera/*/image_raw, and /camera/*/camera_info in a single rosbag2 session. During export to LeRobot, each data point‚Äôs ROS header.stamp is written verbatim into the timestamp attribute. Offline checks show inter-sensor skew stays below ¬±2 ms across a 2-minute capture.*
